# js-bats
ðŸ¦‡ðŸŽƒ Include bats in your web GUI with a small JS file and a single line of code.

First, include the script in your header or footer.

`<script src="http://static.twomile.com/bats.js"></script>`

Then, call makeBats() and give it the number of bats you want to appear. e.g.,

`new BatManager().makeBats(15)`

See the index.html file in this repo for an example.
